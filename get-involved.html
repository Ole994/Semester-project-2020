        <h2>volunteer</h2>
<p>A number of people volunteer their time 
    and effort to keep the displays in good
     order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy.
      Volunteering has its perks including getting to 
      see behind the scenes of a working museum,
       access to staff-only lectures,
        and a monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come 
        together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and 
        strategies for the museum.
</p>


<p>
You can help volunteer in a number of different pheres. Please contact us if you’d like to find out more about how you can get involved.
