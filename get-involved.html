            <h2>volunteer</h2>
            <p>A number of people volunteer their time 
            and effort to keep the displays in good
            order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy.

            see behind the scenes of a working museum,
            access to staff-only lectures,
            and a monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come 
            together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and 
            strategies for the museum.
            </p>
            <p>
            You can help volunteer in a number of different pheres. Please contact us if you’d like to find out more about how you can get involved.
